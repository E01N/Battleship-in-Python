# Battleship
Battleship is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

## How to play
This Batlleship game is based on the classic 1930s pen-and-paper game. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).
This version of the game is single player. 
A 10 X 10 grid is generated along with 5 ships that can be either 3 or 5 spaces long randomly placeed on the grid.
Guesses are made by imputting any letter (A-J) and number (0-9). 
The user's guesses are shown as '#' for a miss and 'X' for a hit.
The user has 50 bullets to try and sink all of the 5 ships. 
If the user can sink all of the ships in 50 or less attemps they win.
If the user runs out of bullets they loose.
